The Collatz program is based on the famous unsolved mathematical problem.The Collatz program checks, within two limits provided by the user, for the number that yields the longest sequence length based on the even-odd number conditions. Specifically, if the number is even, it is divided by 2, whereas if it is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and increased by 1, as outlined in the task instructions. The user inputs two numbers, and by calling the main function, the program verifies whether the given values are acceptable. If the conditions are not met, the program returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds according to the above conditions within a `while` loop using the Collatz function. It then returns the count of times the instructions are executed until the number \( n \) becomes 1. Finally, it checks if the length found for the specific number is greater than the maximum length previously set, and with the `printf` command, it prints the sequence length of interest. For example, if the length is 1, it returns that the sequence length is 1.
